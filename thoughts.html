                It's a very realistic, yet purely fictional account of an unusual discovery by astronomers.
                Written by Fred Hoyle. A Black cloud of dust is coming towards the solar system
                with a mass almost equal to the jupiter.
                Two different observatories witness its effects on the planets and
                eventually arrive at the same conclusion that it will be seen hurtling
                towards our planet in no time... <br><br> To be continued...

                A book and movie, of the same title. <br><br> Reading is usually considered
                a solitary activity and that's how it should be. But won't it be nice
                to read to someone who is genuinely interested in the story
                and equally interested in 'You reading it to them'. A somewhat similar
                setting can be seen in 'The Reader'.

                I have been working on this website since 25th May. And I
                had decided that I'll atleast work on it for a week before
                making it public. All of the codes are written by me. Only
                a few times I took help of google, mostly in the animation
                part and also for some other things. But I don't wanted to
                add something fancy because then I'd have to copy the codes
                and I didn't wanted to do that. So, this website is made with
                purely HTML and CSS. <br><br>Actually, HTML and CSS are quite
                straightforward once you get the hang of it. It's very close
                to english language, but not the programming languages like
                Python or C or Javascript. I still haven't built an intuition
                towards them. Like words come in your mind when you write.
                Similarly, the functions and the logic of the code should come
                to your mind as you write. It surely does happen with HTML and
                CSS but not so much with other languages. But I really want to
                be comfortable with those languages as well.
